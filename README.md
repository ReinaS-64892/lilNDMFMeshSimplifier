## What is this

This is a tool that allows UnityMeshSimplifier to be used as an NDMF plugin.

## Install

Currently this plugin can only be imported by UPM.

```
https://github.com/lilxyzw/lilNDMFMeshSimplifier.git
```

This works as a plugin if NDMF is installed.

## How to use

Just set the quality value. If you simplify a mesh of 10,000 polygons with a quality of 0.5, it will be about 5,000 polygons.

Please refer to the [original documentation](https://github.com/Whinarn/UnityMeshSimplifier/wiki/Mesh-Simplifier-API#simplificationoptions) for other settings.
